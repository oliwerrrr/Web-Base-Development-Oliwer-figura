# Performance Factors Analysis

## Impact of Latency on Download Speed

Correlation: -0.1794
Sample Size: 1290

### Regression Model

Slope: -23.7713
Intercept: 12766912.6121
R² score: 0.0250
- R² (coefficient of determination) measures what percentage of the variability in download speed is explained by the variability in latency. The value of 0.0250 indicates that only 2.5% of the variation in download speed can be explained by latency, suggesting a weak linear relationship.

Mean Absolute Error: 7126082.5791
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error) measures the average absolute difference between actual and predicted speeds in bytes per second. This high value suggests that the model is not precise in predicting download speed based on latency.

Mean Squared Error: 93703486339339.5312

Interpretation: Each additional 1ms of latency decreases download speed by 23.77 bytes/sec.

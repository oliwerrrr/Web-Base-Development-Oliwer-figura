# Analysis of Factors Affecting Performance

## Impact of Latency on Download Speed (sources: data/curr_httpgetmt.csv and data/curr_ping.csv)

Correlation: -0.3354
Sample size: 1427

### Regression Model

Slope coefficient: -27.4364
Intercept: 14,200,980.3092
R² score: 0.1142
- R² (coefficient of determination) measures what percentage of the variability in download speed is explained by the variability in latency. The value of 0.1142 indicates that about 11.42% of the variation in download speed can be explained by latency.

Mean Absolute Error: 5,195,904.7066
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error) measures the average absolute difference between actual and predicted speeds in bytes per second. This value represents the average prediction error of the model.

Mean Squared Error: 38,587,756,745,313.7031

Interpretation: Each additional 1ms of latency decreases download speed by 27.44 bytes/sec.
